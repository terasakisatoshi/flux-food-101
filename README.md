# flux-food-101
Classify Food 101 using Flux.jl

This repository contains how to use pretrained model, define own dataset iterator, ResNet-like layer and so on. 
Due to the critical issue that BatchNorm layer, Advanced layer e,g. MobileNetV2 defined on this slide does not work on GPU, we can't use them right now, but in the future I believe this documentation will helpful for someone who want to learn or use Flux.
